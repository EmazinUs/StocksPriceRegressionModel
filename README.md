## Overview

This project involves creating a model to predict stock prices based on historical data. The data undergoes various preprocessing steps such as outlier removal, feature engineering, and multicollinearity handling. The model uses linear regression for prediction and evaluates its performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
